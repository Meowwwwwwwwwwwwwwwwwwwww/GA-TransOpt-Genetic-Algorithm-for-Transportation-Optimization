Bus Management System
Project Overview
The Bus Management System is a software solution designed to optimize the management of buses, routes, and student assignments in a college or campus environment. It focuses on efficient bus scheduling, route planning, ensuring compliance with capacity and schedule constraints, and minimizing fuel consumption. The system also integrates real-time traffic data to optimize route timing and student distribution.

Key Features
Route Planning and Optimization:

Optimizes bus routes based on travel time, distance, and traffic conditions.

Dynamic route adjustment ensures on-time arrival at all stops.

Student Assignment:

Balances student loads across buses to avoid overcrowding and ensures safe transport.

Students are assigned to buses based on proximity to bus stops and available capacity.

Bus Stop Management:

Tracks bus stop assignments and ensures buses do not exceed their maximum capacity.

Prevents buses from departing without meeting capacity requirements.

Traffic-Aware Travel Time Estimation:

Integrates with real-time traffic data using the OpenRouteService API for accurate travel time estimates.

Ensures dynamic scheduling based on traffic conditions.

Fuel Cost Optimization:

Minimizes fuel consumption by optimizing bus routes.

Reduces operational costs while supporting eco-friendly transportation.

Hard Constraints:

No Overloading: Prevents buses from exceeding their capacity.

College as the Last Stop: Ensures the final stop is always the college campus.

Correct Arrival Time: Ensures buses arrive on time at all stops.

Soft Constraints:

Minimizing Fuel Costs: Reduces fuel consumption by optimizing routes based on traffic and load.

Reducing Repeated Stops: Avoids unnecessary repeated stops to minimize delays.

Balancing Student Loads: Distributes students evenly across buses to optimize comfort and capacity.

Technologies Used
Backend: Python, Django

Database: PostgreSQL (for route and schedule management), MongoDB (for real-time bus data)

API Integration: OpenRouteService API (for traffic-aware travel time)

Optimization: Genetic Algorithm (GA) for route optimization and student assignment

Frontend: Web interface (Django templates or React)

Installation Guide
1. Clone the Repository
bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bus-management-system.git
cd bus-management-system
2. Create a Virtual Environment
bash
Copy
Edit
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate     # On Windows
3. Install Required Dependencies
bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Set Up the Database
Ensure you have PostgreSQL and MongoDB installed.

PostgreSQL Setup:

Create a PostgreSQL database for the project and update the DATABASES setting in settings.py.

Run the migrations:

bash
Copy
Edit
python manage.py migrate
MongoDB Setup:

Install MongoDB and set up a connection in the settings.py file.

5. Run the Development Server
bash
Copy
Edit
python manage.py runserver
This will start the development server at http://127.0.0.1:8000/.

Usage
Bus Management Dashboard:

Access the dashboard via the web interface.

View real-time bus statuses, routes, and student assignments.

Route Optimization:

Use the route optimization feature to view optimized bus routes based on traffic and schedule.

Student Assignment:

Assign students to buses and check for balance across buses to avoid overcrowding.

Traffic Data Integration:

The system uses the OpenRouteService API to estimate travel time between bus stops based on real-time traffic data.
