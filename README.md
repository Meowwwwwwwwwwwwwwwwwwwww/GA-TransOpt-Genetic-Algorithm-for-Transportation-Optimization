# Bus Management System

## Project Overview

The **Bus Management System** is a software solution designed to optimize the management of buses, routes, and student assignments in a college or campus environment. It focuses on efficient bus scheduling, route planning, ensuring compliance with capacity and schedule constraints, and minimizing fuel consumption. The system also integrates real-time traffic data to optimize route timing and student distribution.

## Key Features

### 1. **Route Planning and Optimization**
- Optimizes bus routes based on travel time, distance, and traffic conditions.
- Dynamic route adjustment ensures on-time arrival at all stops.

### 2. **Student Assignment**
- Balances student loads across buses to avoid overcrowding and ensures safe transport.
- Students are assigned to buses based on proximity to bus stops and available capacity.

### 3. **Bus Stop Management**
- Tracks bus stop assignments and ensures buses do not exceed their maximum capacity.
- Prevents buses from departing without meeting capacity requirements.

### 4. **Traffic-Aware Travel Time Estimation**
- Integrates with real-time traffic data using the **OpenRouteService API** for accurate travel time estimates.
- Ensures dynamic scheduling based on traffic conditions.

### 5. **Fuel Cost Optimization**
- Minimizes fuel consumption by optimizing bus routes.
- Reduces operational costs while supporting eco-friendly transportation.

### 6. **Hard Constraints**
- **No Overloading**: Prevents buses from exceeding their capacity.
- **College as the Last Stop**: Ensures the final stop is always the college campus.
- **Correct Arrival Time**: Ensures buses arrive on time at all stops.

### 7. **Soft Constraints**
- **Minimizing Fuel Costs**: Reduces fuel consumption by optimizing routes based on traffic and load.
- **Reducing Repeated Stops**: Avoids unnecessary repeated stops to minimize delays.
- **Balancing Student Loads**: Distributes students evenly across buses to optimize comfort and capacity.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Python, Django
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (for route and schedule management), MongoDB (for real-time bus data)
- **API Integration**: OpenRouteService API (for traffic-aware travel time)
- **Optimization**: Genetic Algorithm (GA) for route optimization and student assignment
- **Frontend**: Web interface (Django templates or React)

## Installation Guide

### 1. **Clone the Repository**

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bus-management-system.git
cd bus-management-system
Usage
1. Bus Management Dashboard:
Access the dashboard via the web interface.

View real-time bus statuses, routes, and student assignments.

2. Route Optimization:
Use the route optimization feature to view optimized bus routes based on traffic and schedule.

3. Student Assignment:
Assign students to buses and check for balance across buses to avoid overcrowding.

4. Traffic Data Integration:
The system uses the OpenRouteService API to estimate travel time between bus stops based on real-time traffic data.
